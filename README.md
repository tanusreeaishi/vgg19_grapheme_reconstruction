# Grapheme Construction using VGG19

Bengali is the 5th most spoken language in the world with hundreds of millions of speakers. It’s the official language of Bangladesh and the second most spoken language in India. Considering its reach, there’s significant business and educational interest in developing AI that can optically recognize images of language handwritten.

## Project Description
Using VGG19 Model, we are predicting Graphemes from the given image and reconstructing the graphemes.
